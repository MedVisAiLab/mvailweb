**There are several projects on medical imaging data, including segmentation, alignment, feature detection and classification.**

---

#### Segmentation

> Segmentation is an important task in medical imaging, and has a wide range of uses such as tissue classification, virtual endoscopy, medical diagnosis, biomedical simulation and modeling. To segment a scan is to the partition the scan into meaningful regions.  In MVAIT, several methods have been developed for the segmentation of imaging data from different modalities, including Magnetic resonance, Ultrosound, Computed tomography, X-ray, Nuclear and Microscopy.
